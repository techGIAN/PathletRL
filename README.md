# PathletRL
A deep learning model based on reinforcement learning to construct pathlet dictionaries.

## Requirements
The code was run in Ubuntu machines, but it can also be run on Macs (based on the packages listed in ```requirements.txt```; for example ```tensorflow-macos``` is specifically for the Mac). In general you can install most of the packages using the following command. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It can be noted that this is mostly built with ```Tensorflow``` and specifically ```tf-agents``` specifically for RL models.
